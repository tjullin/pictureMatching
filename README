An easy game but fun implememnts by JavaFX
Picture matching !
1.How to use:
make sure you have installed JRE and JDKs , use NetBeans to export the project and just compile and run it!
Enjoy it!
2.The rule:
Like the traditional pictureMatching,you need to find the same picture reached to make them fade out.Nothing left and you win.
